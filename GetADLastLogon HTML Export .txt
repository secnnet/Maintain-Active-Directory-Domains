This script was created to maintain Active Directory domains, in checking for enabled, but not-used user accounts. This will display a polished HTML report of all users and various useful properties such as:

    Canonical Name
    SAM Account Name
    Enabled
    Password Expired
    Date Created
    Last LogonDays
    Elapsed Since Last Logon 
    Last Failed Logon 
    Account Age - Days 

The report also gives a total user count in the domain it's run against, as well as the date.

The HTML uses a nice (embedded in the script) CSS with mouse over row highlight, a quaility I use shamelessly in all my HTML reports, for easy reading, along with alternating row colors.

This script is a great way to keep your AD environment secure (by cleaning out unused accounts that can be means of authentication to a malicious user, former employee, etc) and clean of unneeded data.
